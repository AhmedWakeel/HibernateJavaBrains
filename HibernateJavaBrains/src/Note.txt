- Hibernate is an ORM tool.


@Transient    // if we make any field transient then hibernate will igonre the that field and will not create the column in the table.
@Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)  // save only date and not time
@Lob   // by default hibernate uses 255 characters but if want to save more than that then we can use Large object , BLOB binary large object , CLOB character large object

- SessionFactory created only once per application , since it is a very expensive object but we can create session as many we want.
- @GeneratedValue // this annotation is used to add values automatically to the primary key column

- @Embedded : this annotation is used to indicate that this entity will be added into the other entity, it is used on the Object variable 
              of the class.
              
- @Embaddable : this is used on the top the class name to indicate that this entity can be used or store into the another entity

-@EmbeddedId :  if we want to make any Embeddable object as a primary key in a entity class then we have to use @EmbeddedId

- @ElementCollection : this annotation is used to save the collection object in the entity class , but it will creates the new table in the database
                       the new table name will be the combination of the current Entity class name and collection variable name
